# Python Data Handling Study Repository 📊🐍

Welcome to my personal learning journey with Python! This repository is my digital garden 🌱, where I cultivate my notes, assignments, and projects related to data processing with Python.

## About the Repository 📘

As I explore the vast landscape of Python, I'm thrilled to share the fruits of my learning here. You'll find:

- **Notes**: My digital scribbles on key concepts 📝.
- **Assignments**: Exercises and solutions that helped cement my understanding 🏋️‍♂️.
- **Projects**: Real-world applications of data handling where I've put theory into practice 🌟.

## My Learning Path 🛤️

I've embarked on an educational adventure with [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), following the guidance of two esteemed professors from Rice University. Here are the courses that have shaped my journey:

- **Python Data Representations**: Diving into the intricacies of data structures and representations in Python.
- **Python Programming Essentials**: Building a solid foundation in Python coding essentials for data analysis.

Currently, I'm delving deeper into data analysis, expanding my skills and understanding of how to extract meaningful insights from data.
